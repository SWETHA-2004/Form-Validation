## Form Validation

## Problem Statement:

Develop a web-based form that allows users to input their details and implements both client-side validation and human verification mechanisms. 
The validation should ensure that all required fields are correctly filled in with appropriate data types (e.g., email, phone number, etc.). 

## Problem Description

The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly and secure online form that allows individuals to enter and submit their personal information.
Forms are a vital part of most websites, used for everything from registrations and contact inquiries to surveys and feedback collection.
However, collecting user data effectively requires more than just displaying input fields—it also involves validating the information to ensure it is complete, accurate, and in the correct format.
To achieve this, the form will include client-side validation, which checks the user’s inputs in real-time before the form is submitted. 
For example, it will verify that required fields are not left blank, that an email address contains the proper format, and that a phone number consists only of digits.
